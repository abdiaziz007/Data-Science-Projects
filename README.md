# Online-Challenge
Challenge submitted on HackerRank and Kaggle.

Algorithm challenges are made on HackerRank using Python.

Data Science and Machine Learning challenges are made on Kaggle using Python too. 


## [Face Recognition](https://github.com/abdiaziz007/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/FaceRecognition)

Modern face recognition with deep learning and HOG algorithm. Using dlib C++ library, I have a quick face recognition tool using few pictures (20 per person).

## [Playing with Soccer data](https://github.com/abdiaziz007/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/KaggleSoccer)

As a soccer fan and a data passionate, I wanted to play and analyze with soccer data.  
I don't know currently what's the aim of this project but I will parse data from diverse websites, for differents teams and differents players.
